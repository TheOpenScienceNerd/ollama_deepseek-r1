      "Okay, I need to write a Python function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius. Let me think about how to approach this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember the formula for converting Fahrenheit (F) to Celsius (C). It's C = (F - 92) * 5/9 or wait, no, let me check that again. Oh right, it should be (F - 32) multiplied by 5/9. So the correct formula is C = (F - 32) * (5/9).\n",
      "\n",
      "So my function will take a Fahrenheit temperature as input and return the equivalent Celsius.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's outline the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define a function named fahrenheit_to_celsius that takes one argument, F.\n",
      "2. Inside the function, apply the formula: subtract 32 from F, multiply by 5/9.\n",
      "3. Return the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure to handle any potential data types correctly. Since F is presumably a number (int or float), there shouldn't be issues here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing some examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if F is 32, then C should be 0. Let me plug into the formula: (32 -32)*5/9=0. Correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another test case: 212°F should convert to 100°C. Using the formula: (212-32)=180 *5/9 = 100. Good.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about a negative temperature? Like -40°F is the same as -40°C. So if F is -40, C should be (-40 -32)*5/9. Let me calculate that: -72 *5= -360; divided by 9 is -40. Correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about if someone inputs a string? Oh wait, in Python, the function will raise an error because it can't perform mathematical operations on strings. So I should ensure that the input is numeric. Maybe add a check at the beginning or handle type conversion. But since the problem doesn't mention handling invalid inputs, perhaps just proceed without checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "So writing the code:\n",
      "\n",
      "def fahrenheit_to_celsius(F):\n",
      "    C = (F - 32) * 5/9\n",
      "    return C\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that should do it.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve this problem, we need to write a function that converts a given temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The conversion formula is well-established in physics and can be used directly with minimal computational effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Approach\n",
      "The approach involves using the standard temperature conversion formula between Fahrenheit and Celsius:\n",
      "\\[ C = (F - 32) \\times \\frac{5}{9} \\]\n",
      "Where \\( F \\) is the temperature in Fahrenheit and \\( C \\) is the temperature in Celsius. The function will take a single argument, which is the temperature in Fahrenheit, apply the formula to convert it to Celsius, and return the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Solution Code\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def fahrenheit_to_celsius(F):\n",
      "    c = (F - 32) * 5 / 9\n",
      "    return c\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation\n",
      "1. **Function Definition**: The function `fahrenheit_to_celsius` is defined to take one parameter, `F`, which represents the temperature in Fahrenheit.\n",
      "2. **Conversion Formula Application**: Inside the function, the formula \\((F - 32) \\times \\frac{5}{9}\\) is applied to convert the given Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius.\n",
      "3. **Return Result**: The calculated Celsius value is returned as the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach ensures that any valid numeric input in Fahrenheit is correctly converted to its equivalent in Celsius using a straightforward mathematical formula.\n"

      "Okay, I need to figure out how to convert a Python function into C#. Let's start by understanding what the original Python code does. The user mentioned they have a function but didn't specify it, so I'll make some assumptions based on common tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, if the function is about converting text to ASCII values, that's straightforward. In Python, I can use the `ord()` function for lowercase letters and `chr()` for uppercase. But in C#, we don't have these built-in functions by default, so I'll need a custom method.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I'll write a method called `TextToASCII` that takes a string and returns another object (probably an array of integers) containing each character's ASCII value. For lowercase letters, it will be 'a'-'z', which correspond to 97-122, and for uppercase, it's 'A'-'Z', from 65 to 90.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the method handles each character correctly. If a character isn't in the ASCII range (32 to 126), I might return null or handle it differently, but perhaps just leaving it as is for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I'll think about error handling. What if someone passes a non-string argument? In Python, we can check with `isinstance`, so in C# I should first verify that the input is a string and not null or some other type. If it's not a string, maybe return null or throw an exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to consider that each character might not have an ASCII value if it's outside this range. For example, Unicode characters can go much higher than 126. So in such cases, the function could just return null because there's no corresponding integer for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I'll write a method that processes each character of the input string and returns an array of integers representing their ASCII values. If any character is invalid (not in lowercase or uppercase English letters), the method will handle it gracefully, possibly by skipping those characters or returning null.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but what about non-ASCII characters? They won't have a valid integer value, so they should be ignored unless we need to process them as well. I'll include all characters and check if their ASCII code is between 32 and 126 before adding the value to the array.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me outline the steps:\n",
      "1. Initialize an empty list to hold the integers.\n",
      "2. Iterate over each character in the input string.\n",

      "Testing this with some examples: For F = 32, C should be 0. Using the formula, (32 - 32)*5/9 is indeed 0. Another example, F = 212 converts to 100°C because (212 - 32) * 5 / 9 equals 180 * 5 /9 which is 100.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider edge cases like negative temperatures and non-integer values. For instance, if F = -40, the result in Celsius should be -40 as well since (-40 -32)*5/9 = (-72)*5/9 = -40.\n",

      "I need to ensure that the code compiles correctly. In C#, I'll have to add using directives at the top, but since this is a standalone method, it's not necessary here. However, in practice, they might be included if there's an existing namespace or class.\n",

      "\n",
      "To solve this problem, we need to write a function that converts a given temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The conversion formula is well-established in physics and can be used directly with minimal computational effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Approach\n",
      "The approach involves using the standard temperature conversion formula between Fahrenheit and Celsius:\n",
      "\\[ C = (F - 32) \\times \\frac{5}{9} \\]\n",
      "Where \\( F \\) is the temperature in Fahrenheit and \\( C \\) is the temperature in Celsius. The function will take a single argument, which is the temperature in Fahrenheit, apply the formula to convert it to Celsius, and return the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Solution Code\n",
      "```csharp\n",
      "public class TemperatureConverter\n",
      "{\n",
      "    public static double ConvertFahrenheitToCelsius(double fahrenheit)\n",
      "    {\n",
      "        return (fahrenheit - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0;\n",
      "    }\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation\n",
      "1. **Function Definition**: The function `ConvertFahrenheitToCelsius` is defined to take one parameter, `fahrenheit`, which represents the temperature in Fahrenheit.\n",
      "2. **Conversion Formula Application**: Inside the function, the formula \\((\\text{F} - 32) \\times \\frac{5}{9}\\) is applied to convert the given Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius.\n",
      "3. **Return Result**: The calculated Celsius value is returned as the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach ensures that any valid numeric input in Fahrenheit is correctly converted to its equivalent in Celsius using a straightforward mathematical formula.\n"
