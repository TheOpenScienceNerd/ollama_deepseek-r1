      "Okay, I need to write a Python function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius. Let me think about how to approach this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember the formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is (F - 9) × 5/9 = C. So the steps are: take the input temperature in Fahrenheit, subtract 32 from it, multiply by 5, then divide by 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The correct formula is (°F - 32) multiplied by 5/9 to get Celsius. Yeah, I got that right earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the function should take one argument, which is the Fahrenheit temperature. Then apply this formula and return the result as a float or an integer? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, so maybe returning a float is fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll name the function something like fahrenheit_to_celsius. Let's call it def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit): \n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the function, I'll take the input, subtract 32, multiply by 5/9. Return the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, what about handling cases where the input is a list or another data type? Well, since Fahrenheit is typically a number, but if someone passes something else, it might cause an error. But maybe the function should handle that gracefully, perhaps return None or raise a TypeError. Hmm, not sure if I need to consider that here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me test with some examples. For example, 32°F should be 0°C. Plugging into the formula: (32 -32) *5/9 = 0, correct. Another example: 100°F is 40°C? Let's see: (100-32)=68 *5=340 /9 ≈ 37.777... Wait no, wait that can't be right because I think I might have confused the formula.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait wait, hold on! No, sorry, I mixed up something. Let me recalculate: (°F -32) × 5/9 = °C. So for 100°F: 100-32=68 *5=340 /9 ≈ 37.777°C? Wait, no! No, wait that's not correct because I think I made a mistake in the example. Let me check online—wait, what is 100°F in Celsius?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh right, 100°F is approximately 26.804°C. So maybe my initial test case was wrong. But regardless, the formula is (°F -32) ×5/9.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone passes 32, returns 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passes 50: 18 *5=90 /9=10, so 10°C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that's correct because 50°F is about 10°C. Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another test case: What about -40? Both scales should be equal. Let me see: (-40-32) = -72 *5/9 = -40. So yes, the function returns correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think my approach is solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, writing the code:\n",
      "\n",
      "def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):\n",
      "    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9\n",
      "    return celsius\n",
      "\n",

      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve this problem, we need to create a function that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is well-established and can be directly implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Approach\n",
      "The approach involves using the standard temperature conversion formula:\n",
      "\\[ C = (F - 32) \\times \\frac{5}{9} \\]\n",
      "where \\( F \\) is the temperature in Fahrenheit and \\( C \\) is the temperature in Celsius. The function will take a single argument, the temperature in Fahrenheit, apply this formula, and return the result.\n",

      "```python\n",
      "def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):\n",

      "Okay, so I need to convert a Python function I wrote into Rust. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I should probably write out what my Python code does because without knowing that, it's hard to translate accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me take an example. Suppose the Python function is a simple addition: def add(a, b): return a + b. Now, translating this into Rust would require replacing the function signature with a similar one but using Rust's syntax and features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but adding two numbers in Rust can be done just by taking two arguments of type i32 or u32 and returning their sum. So, maybe I should write something like:\n",

      "Wait, but in Rust, we don't have optional types for generics like Python's @param. So, the function would need to be generic and type-hinted. I can use #[ generalize ] or #[derive(Debug) ] tags if needed.\n",

      "1. **Function Definition**: The function `FahrenheitToCelsius` is defined to take a single parameter, `fahrenheit`, which represents the temperature in Fahrenheit.\n",
      "2. **Conversion Formula**: Inside the function, we apply the formula `(fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9` to convert the given Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius.\n",
      "3. **Return Result**: The computed Celsius value is returned as a double.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach ensures accurate conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius using a straightforward mathematical operation, which can be easily implemented in C#.\n"
